                                            <li>Hi there, {{@Auth::user()->name}}! Congratulations on taking the important step of creating your Will.</li>

                                            <li>This is the most crucial document of your life, and the online Will making process is a breeze.
                                                You'll find it intuitive, logical, and completely trouble-free. You've already entered
                                                your personal details when you signed up, and now it's time to fill in the rest of
                                                the details to generate your Will in the form of a pdf document. You can edit
                                                the details and regenerate a modified pdf document during a 30 day period, but after that,
                                                you'll need to purchase a new package to create a new Will because we will purge all details
                                                from our systems</li>

                                            <li>Once you're satisfied with your Will, you'll need to download and print it on a sturdy A4 paper.
                                                Sign the printed Will on all pages and on the designated spot indicated with your name on the last page. </li>

                                            <li>Don't forget to obtain the signatures of your witnesses on the same day. Remember,
                                                the witnesses and you must sign the Will on the same date. </li>

                                            <li>Please keep the printed and signed copy in a safe and accessible place once your Will is executed.
                                                If you wish to, you can register the location of your Will with us using the <a class="txt_href" href="{{route('service_detail',[2])}}">Will Location Registry package.</a>
                                                After you pass away, your beneficiaries, executors, or any other person you nominate can retrieve the location of your
                                                Will by uploading a copy of your death certificate. </li>

                                            <li>We encourage you to take this first step in securing your loved onesâ€™
                                                future by adding the Executor of your Will, Beneficiaries, Witnesses, and details of your assets. </li>
